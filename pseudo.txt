a functional Express.js API

I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

.env
DB_NAME: some_db
DB_USER: someuser
DB_PASS: somepass

I enter schema and seed commands
a development database is created and is seeded with test data
path to db -> C:\Users\trist\bootcamp\homework\MyEcommerceBackEnd\db

mysql -u root -p
root

source schema.sql

node seeds/index.js

I enter the command to invoke the application
my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

node server.js

update columns in models to relate to one another in the db

I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
